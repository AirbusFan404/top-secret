# Top Secret

**Top Secret** is a lightweight Python module that converts `dict[str, str]` objects into obfuscated strings called *top secrets*.

It is:

* Reversible
* Deterministic (based on a seed)
* Non–human-readable
* Not cryptographically secure

It is designed for situations where you want to discourage manual editing of configuration data without introducing full encryption complexity.

---

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

* Do **not** manually edit generated top secrets.
* Do **not** store sensitive information in top secrets.
* Do **not** change the seed unless all previously generated top secrets are backed up.

This project is **obfuscation**, not encryption.

---

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AirbusFan404/top-secret.git
```

Requires:

* Python ≥ 3.10
* `typing_extensions`

---

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import top_secret

data = {
    "foo": "bar",
    "spam": "eggs"
}

# Convert to obfuscated string
encoded = top_secret.dumps(data)

# Convert back to dictionary
decoded = top_secret.loads(encoded)

assert decoded == data
```

---

### File-Based Usage

```python
import top_secret

data = {"username": "admin", "mode": "debug"}

# Write to file
with open("config.secret", "w") as f:
    top_secret.dump(data, f)

# Read from file
with open("config.secret", "r") as f:
    restored = top_secret.load(f)
```

---

## How It Works (Conceptual Overview)

Each character is:

1. Converted to its Unicode code point.
2. Transformed mathematically using a seed-derived multiplier and offset.
3. Converted to hexadecimal.
4. Substituted through a seeded cipher mapping.

Because all transformations depend on a shared seed, encoding and decoding remain consistent.

---

## Seed System

Top Secret derives its deterministic behavior from a seed. The seed is loaded using the following priority:

1. `SECRETSEED` environment variable (hex string)
2. `SECRETFILE` environment variable (path to file containing hex seed)
3. `~/.secretseed` file
4. If none exist, a new random seed is generated and saved to `~/.secretseed`

### Example: Setting a Seed

```bash
export SECRETSEED=1a2b3c4d
```

The seed must be a hexadecimal integer.

Changing the seed will make previously generated top secrets undecodable.

## API Reference

### Encoding

* `dumps(obj: dict[str, str]) -> str`
* `dump(obj: dict[str, str], fp: TextIO) -> int`

Raises:

* `TopSecretEncodeError`
* `SeedError`

---

### Decoding

* `loads(s: str) -> dict[str, str]`
* `load(fp: TextIO) -> dict[str, str]`

Raises:

* `TopSecretDecodeError`
* `SeedError`

---

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
